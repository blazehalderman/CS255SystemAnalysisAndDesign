1. Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

* The DriverPass project was presented by the DriverPass team. They sought to develop a system for new drivers to train and organize for drivers ed exams. The system needed to consist of a client-server architecture and be mobile friendly for its users. This app was intended to act as a *concierge* like managment system for drivers ed appointments and exams. The users needed to be able to view their prior test scores and book driving test appointments.

2. What did you do particularly well?

* In particular, I tackled the system from a top-down view rather then a bottom-up approach, which meant designing the system from its core functions first and then designing individual smaller system on their own later. I chose to design DriverPass as a client-server architecture with a database management system for user credentials. I also had security in mind, which meant designing user access from the principle of least privilage access, which limited any users control access of the application.

3. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

* I would most likely revise the DriverPass Client-Server Application UML Case diagram since I think it's a bit too cluttered and not effectively refined. I think I could to a better job at defining specific functionalities for the core system in a more detailed and simplified manner. Limiting the complexity of the diagram can also make it more readable to designers.

4. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

* I interpreted the DriverPass user's needs by first understanding how the system was previously being used and having more knowledge on the process for taking a drivers ed examination. It's important to gain perspective from the users point of view in order to design the system effectively. It's important to consider the users needs for users satisfaction and performance of the system, otherwise the system amy not be used as intended.

5. How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

* The approach for designing software first begins with understanding the pre-requesities or requirements of the system. Understanding what the system will need and how the system will operate are crucial to designing the system effectively and optimally for various systems. It's important to note that the more effective the requirements document is, the less problematic the system will be during development. Mastering the requirements segment of an application is crucial to the longterm success of the application and it's functionality. During development, it's important to continuously keep the users in mind and design from the users perspective of the system. Gaining user feedback is also crucial and potentially launching a beta or alpha version of the application will prove beneficial for key development milestones.
